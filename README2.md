Learn German Playing
A game that you can learn basic words in German, created using HTML, CSS and JS.
The player can choose Numbers(MVP for this Game), Animals, Colors or Food.
The words will have an audio. After learning the user can play. An audio will play with the name of the . 3 alternatives  will show and they must click in the one that corresponds to the right alternative. 
I choose this game so I could use some of the previous concepts taught in class, and since iâ€™ve just started learning German, I can use my own game.
